Introduction {#intro}
=====================

When using downloadable webfonts via ''@font-face'',
the user agent needs to know what to do while the font is actively loading.
Most web browsers have adopted some form of timeout:

<table class='data'>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Browser
			<th>Timeout
			<th>Fallback
			<th>Swap
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<th>Chrome 35+
			<td>3 seconds
			<td>yes
			<td>yes
		<tr>
			<th>Opera
			<td>3 seconds
			<td>yes
			<td>yes
		<tr>
			<th>Firefox
			<td>3 seconds
			<td>yes
			<td>yes
		<tr>
			<th>Internet Explorer
			<td>0 seconds
			<td>yes
			<td>yes
		<tr>
			<th>Safari
			<td>no timeout
			<td>n/a
			<td>n/a
</table>

* Chrome and Firefox have a 3 second timeout after which the text is shown with the fallback font.
	Eventually, a swap occurs:
	the text is re-rendered with the intended font once it becomes available.
* Internet Explorer has a 0 second timeout which results in immediate text rendering:
	if the requested font is not yet available,
	fallback is used,
	and text is rerendered later once the requested font becomes available.
* Safari has no timeout behavior
	(or at least nothing beyond a baseline network timeout)

While these default behaviors are reasonable,
they're unfortunately inconsistent across browsers.
Worse, no single approach is sufficient to cover the range of use-cases
required by modern user-experience&ndash; and performance&ndash;conscious applications.

The Font Loading API [[CSS-FONT-LOADING-3]] allows a developer to override some of the above behaviors,
but that requires scripting,
a non-trivial amount of effort,
and ultimately doesn't provide sufficient hooks to cover <em>all</em> reasonable cases.
Additionally,
the developer needs to either inline the loading script into their page
or load an external library,
introducing additional network latency before the fonts can be loaded
and delaying text rendering.

Design/performance-conscious web developers have a good sense for the relative importance of a given web font for the intended user experience.
This specification provides them the ability to control font timeout and rendering behavior.
Specifically, it lets developers:

* Define the font rendering strategy when text is ready to be painted: block, or paint with fallback.
* Define the font rendering behavior once the desired font is available: rerender text with the new font, or leave it with the fallback.
* Define custom timeout values for each font.
* Define custom render and timeout strategies per element.


Controlling Font Rendering Per Font-Face: the ''@font-face/font-display'' descriptor {#font-rendering-desc}
===========================

The '@font-face/font-display' descriptor for ''@font-face''
determines how a font face is displayed,
based on whether and when it is downloaded and ready to use.

When a downloadable font-face is first requested,
a <a>font download timer</a> is started.
Each ''@font-face'' rule has associated with it
two periods of time--
a <a>block duration</a>
and a <a>swap duration</a>--
which determine the rendering behavior of the font face
as its <a>timer</a> advances.

<pre class='descdef'>
Name: font-display
Value: auto | block | swap | fallback | optional
Initial: auto
For: @font-face
</pre>

Note: For all of these values,
user agents may use slightly different durations,
or more sophisticated behaviors that can't be directly expressed in the 'font-display' syntax,
in order to provide more useful behavior for their users.
They may also provide the ability for users to override author-chosen behavior
with something more desirable;
for example, forcing all fonts to have a ''0s'' <a>block duration</a>.

<dl dfn-type="value" dfn-for="@font-face/font-rendering">
	<dt><dfn>auto</dfn>
	<dd>
		The font display strategy is user-agent-defined.

		Note: Many browsers have a default strategy similar to that specified by ''block''.

	<dt><dfn>block</dfn>
	<dd>
		Gives the font face a short <a>block duration</a>
		(''3s'' is recommended in most cases)
		and an infinite <a>swap duration</a>.

		Note: In other words, the browser draws "invisible" text at first if it's not loaded,
		but swaps the font face in as soon as it loads.

		This value must only be used when rendering text in a particular font is required for the page to be usable.
		It must only be used for small pieces of text.

		<div class="example">
			For example, badly designed "icon fonts" might associate a "âŽ™" (print) icon
			with an unrelated character like "C",
			so if the text is displayed with a fallback font instead
			there will be confusing letters scattered around the page
			rather than the desired icon.
			In this case, temporary blank spots are better than using a fallback font.

			(However, the fallback font is used <em>eventually</em>,
			as having confusing letters scattered around the page
			is better than having links and such never show up at all.)
		</div>

	<dt><dfn>swap</dfn>
	<dd>
		Gives the font face a ''0s'' <a>block duration</a>
		and an infinite <a>swap duration</a>.

		Note: In other words, the browser draws the text immediately with a fallback if the font face isn't loaded,
		but swaps the font face in as soon as it loads.

		This value should only be used when rendering text in a particular font is very important for the page,
		but rendering in any font will still get a correct message across.
		It should only be used for small pieces of text.

		<div class='example'>
			For example,
			if a website has a custom font for rendering their logo,
			rendering that logo correctly is fairly important for branding purposes,
			but displaying the logo in any font will at least get the point across without confusion.
		</div>

	<dt><dfn>fallback</dfn>
	<dd>
		Gives the font face a ''0s'' <a>block duration</a>
		and a short <a>swap duration</a>
		(''3s'' is recommended in most cases).

		Note: In other words, the font face is rendered with a fallback at first if it's not loaded,
		but it's swapped in as soon as it loads.
		However, if too much time passes,
		the fallback will be used for the rest of the page's lifetime instead.

		This value should be used for body text,
		or any other text where the use of the chosen font is useful and desired,
		but it's acceptable for the user to see the text in a fallback font.
		This value is appropriate to use for large pieces of text.

		<div class="example">
			For example,
			in large pieces of body text,
			it's most important just to get the text rendered quickly,
			so the user can begin to read as quickly as possible.
			Further, once the user has started reading,
			they shouldn't be disturbed by the text suddenly "shifting"
			as a new font is swapped in,
			as that's distracting and annoying to re-find where one was in the text.
		</div>

		Issue: Maybe give this a very small <a>block duration</a>,
		so we can avoid FOUT if the font is available but hasn't been loaded from cache yet?

	<dt><dfn>optional</dfn>
	<dd>
		Gives the font face an extremely small <a>block duration</a>
		(''100ms'' or less is recommended in most cases)
		and a ''0s'' <a>swap duration</a>.

		If the font is not retrieved before the two durations expire,
		the user agent may choose to abort the font download,
		or download it with a very low priority.
		If the user agent believes it would be useful for the user,
		it may avoid even starting the font download,
		and proceed immediately to using a fallback font.

		Note: In other words, the font is used if it's already downloaded and available,
		but otherwise a fallback is used for the rest of the page's lifetime instead.
		The font might download in the background and be available to future page loads,
		but if the user-agent detects that the user has very limited bandwidth,
		it might choose to simply never download and use the font.

		This value should be used for body text,
		or any other text where the chosen font is purely a decorative "nice-to-have".
		It should be used anytime it is more important that the web page render quickly on first visit,
		than it is that the user wait a longer time to see everything perfect immediately.

		<div class='example'>
			For example, body text is perfectly readable in one of the browser default fonts,
			though a downloadable font face may be more attractive
			and mesh with the site's aesthetics better.
			First time visitors to a site generally care far more about the site being quickly usable
			than they do about the finer points of its display,
			and ''optional'' provides a good behavior for them.
			If they return later,
			the desired font faces might have finished downloading,
			giving them the "intended" experience without slowing down
			either their first or subsequent visits.

			Users on very slow connections might not ever receive the "intended" experience,
			but ''optional'' ensures they can actually <em>use</em> the site,
			rather than quitting and going elsewhere because the site takes too long to load.
		</div>
</dl>

<div class='issue'>
	These names aren't great.
	It would probably be better to use "intent" names
	that immediately capture the intended usage of each.
	Some suggestions:

	* required / important / preferable / optional
</div>

Issue: ''fallback'' and ''optional'' can result in some faces in a family being used
while others are required to fallback,
giving a "ransom note" look.
Perhaps require that all fonts in a family have the same behavior (all swapped in, or all fallback)?

At the moment the user agent first attempts to use a given downloaded font face on a page,
it must start a <dfn local-lt="timer">font download timer</dfn> for that font face,
ending when the font face is finished loading and ready to use.

The <dfn>block duration</dfn> for a font face defines a span of time
starting when the font face's <a>timer</a> starts
and ending when the specified duration has passed.
During this period,
if the font face has not yet loaded
it must be considered "not available",
but must fallback to the <a>invisible font face</a>.

The <dfn>swap duration</dfn> for a font face defines a span of time
starting when the font face's <a>block duration</a> ends
and ending when the specified duration has passed.
During this period,
if the font face has not yet loaded
it must be considered "not available",
and fallback as normal.

If the font face loads during the <a>block duration</a> or the <a>swap duration</a>,
the font face is considered to have successfully loaded and is available to the page for use.
If both durations expire without the font face loading,
the user agent must mark the font face as "not available"
for the rest of the lifetime of the document,
even if the font face later loads successfully.

The <dfn export>invisible font face</dfn> is a special user-agent-defined font face.
It contains glyphs for every possible character,
but renders all of them as transparent boxes
with user-agent-defined metrics.
It exists solely to allow user agents to perform text layout with reasonable default text sizing
while a font face is being blocked from rendering.

Issue: Nope, this should use the metrics of whatever fallback font will be used.
That avoids any reflow at all if you switch from blank to fallback.
