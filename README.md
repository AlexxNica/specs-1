specs
=====

Spec proposals that aren't yet approved by the relevant Working Group.  Everything in here is my own work and not endorsed by the relevant Working Group.  (Unless I'm working on a new version of an existing spec, in which case existing parts of it might not be my own work.) 

Live copies of the specs, using rawgithub.com because I'm too lazy to maintain a `gh-pages` branch:
