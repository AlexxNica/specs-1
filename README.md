specs
=====

Spec proposals that aren't yet approved by the relevant Working Group.  Everything in here is my own work and not endorsed by the relevant Working Group.  (Unless I'm working on a new version of an existing spec, in which case existing parts of it might not be my own work.) 

Live copies of the specs:
