Abstract: This specification defines methods of defining “aliases” for long or commonly-used values in several CSS features, reducing repetition in the stylesheet.
</pre>

<h2 id='intro'>
Introduction</h2>

	When authoring CSS,
	one often encounters significant repetition in certain features.
	For example, a given media query might be repeated in several places,
	or a selector meant to apply to all heading elements
	requires specifying '':matches(h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6)'' in every location that uses it.

	This repetition makes stylesheets more verbose and difficult to read,
	and also affects maintenance,
	as the author has to keep each repetition in sync when making any changes.

	This specification defines aliasing methods for several CSS features--
	media queries and selectors--
	so that a long or repeatedly-used value can be given a short, memorable name instead.
	This makes stylesheets easier to read,
	and allows authors to maintain only a single copy of the value,
	so changes are automatically propagated to each use.

	Note: The features in this specification are thematically similar to <a>custom properties</a> and <a>variables</a>,
	but use a different, simpler definition and use syntax.

<h2 id='custom-mq'>
Custom Media Queries</h2>

	A <dfn>custom media query</dfn> is defined with the ''@custom-media'' rule:

	<pre class='prod'><dfn>@custom-media</dfn> = @custom-media <<custom-name>> <<media-query>> ;</pre>

	Where <dfn>&lt;custom-name></dfn> is a <<custom-ident>> with at least one <code>_</code> (underscore, U+005F LOW LINE) in it.

	This defines that the <a>custom media query</a> named by the <<custom-name>> represents the given <<media-query>>.

	Note: It's recommended that the name either starts with the underscore,
	following the somewhat similar notation in JavaScript, Python, and other computer languages,
	or that the underscore is used as a separator between a simple "namespace" and the actual name of the <a>custom media query</a>,
	such as ''jq_small-screen''.
	Either of these methods makes the underscore fairly visually obvious in its use,
	preventing accidental confusion with CSS-defined <a>media queries</a>.

	The <<custom-name>> can then be used in a <a>media feature</a>.
	It <strong>must</strong> be used in a <a>boolean context</a>;
	using them in a normal or <a>range context</a> is a syntax error.
	The <a>custom media query</a> evaluates to true if the <<media-query>> it represents evaluates to true,
	and false otherwise.

	<div class='example'>
		For example, if a responsive site uses a particular breakpoint in several places,
		it can alias that with a reasonable name:

		<pre>
			@custom-media _narrow-window (max-width: 30em);

			@media (_narrow-window) {
				/* narrow window styles */
			}
			@media (_narrow-window) and (script) {
				/* special styles for when script is allowed */
			}
			/* etc */
		</pre>
	</div>

Script-based Custom Media Queries</h3>

	<div class='issue'>
		Define a map of names to values for JS.
		Values can be either a MediaQueryList object or a boolean,
		in which case it's treated identically to the above,
		or can be a number or a string,
		in which case it's treated like a normal MQ,
		and can use the normal or range context syntax.
		Like:

		<pre>
			&lt;script>
			CSS.customMedia.set('_foo', 5);
			&lt;/script>
			&lt;style>
			@media (_foo: 5) { ... }
			@media (_foo < 10) { ... }
			&lt;/style>
		</pre>
	</div>

Custom Selectors</h2>

	A <dfn>custom selector</dfn> is defined with the ''@custom-selector'' rule:

	<pre class='prod'><dfn>@custom-selector</dfn> = @custom-selector <<custom-name>> <<selector>> ;</pre>

	This defines a <a>custom selector</a> which is written as a <a>pseudo-class</a> with the given <<custom-name>>,
	and represents a '':matches()'' selector using the provided <<selector>> as its argument.

	Similar to <a>custom media queries</a>,
	the name of a <a>custom selector</a> must contain an underscore character.

	<div class='example'>
		For example, if an author wanted to easily refer to all heading elements in their HTML document,
		they could create an alias:

		<pre>
			@custom-selector :_heading h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6;

			:_heading { /* styles for all headings */ }
			:_heading + p { /* more styles */ }
			/* etc */
		</pre>
	</div>

<h3 id='script-custom-selectors'>
Script-based Custom Selectors</h3>

	<div class='issue'>
		This one's more complicated than MQs.
		Brian Kardell came up with a good proposal for evaluating selectors as JS functions that return a boolean,
		which had decent performance characteristics by specifying the qualities of the element it was based on
		(which determined when it would be called).

		<pre>
		&lt;script>
		CSS.customSelector.set("_foo",
			                   {"filter": function(el){...},
			                   	"matches": "a",
			                    "examines": "[href]"});
		&lt;/script>
		</pre>

		"matches" is an optional selector specifying what subset of elements the custom selector is valid for.
		The selector is automatically false for elements that don't match.

		"examines" is a list of simple selectors specifying what sort of updates the selector should be called for.
		In this example, any changes to the <code>href</code> attribute would cause the function to be called.
		What elements are the "examines" selectors applied to?
		We probably need a way to manually trigger re-evaluation, too.
		Is this just sugar over mutation listeners + manual re-evaluation?

		Maybe let the pseudo-class also accept an argument,
		and pass it (as a serialized string) as a second argument to the matching function.
		'':_foo'' would pass <code>null</code>,
		while '':_foo()'' would pass <code>""</code>.
	</div>
