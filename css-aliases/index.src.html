Abstract: This specification defines methods of defining “aliases” for long or commonly-used values in several CSS features, reducing repetition in the stylesheet.

<h2 id='intro'>
Introduction</h2>

	When authoring CSS,
	one often encounters significant repetition in certain features.
	For example, a given media query might be repeated in several places,
	or a selector meant to apply to all heading elements
	requires specifying '':matches(h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6)'' in every location that uses it.

	This repetition makes stylesheets more verbose and difficult to read,
	and also affects maintenance,
	as the author has to keep each repetition in sync when making any changes.

	This specification defines aliasing methods for several CSS features,
	so that a long or repeatedly-used value can be given a short, memorable name instead.
	This makes stylesheets easier to read,
	and allows authors to maintain only a single copy of the value,
	so changes are automatically propagated to each use.

	Note: The features in this specification are thematically similar to <a>custom properties</a> and <a>variables</a>,
	but use a different, simpler definition and use syntax.

Custom Media Queries</h2>

	A <dfn>custom media query</dfn> is defined with the ''@custom-media'' rule:

	<pre class='prod'><dfn>@custom-media</dfn> = @custom-media <<custom-media-name>> <<media-query>> ;</pre>

	Where <dfn>&lt;custom-media-name></dfn> is a <<custom-ident>> with at least one <code>_</code> (underscore, U+005F LOW LINE) in it.

	This defines that the <a>custom media query</a> named by the <<custom-media-name>> represents the given <<media-query>>.

	Note: It's recommended that the name either starts with the underscore,
	following the somewhat similar notation in JavaScript, Python, and other computer languages,
	or that the underscore is used as a separator between a simple "namespace" and the actual name of the <a>custom media query</a>,
	such as ''jq_small-screen''.
	Either of these methods makes the underscore fairly visually obvious in its use,
	preventing accidental confusion with CSS-defined <a>media queries</a>.

	The <<custom-media-name>> can then be used in a <a>media feature</a>.
	It <strong>must</strong> be used in a <a>boolean context</a>;
	using them in a normal or <a>range context</a> is a syntax error.
	The <a>custom media query</a> evaluates to true if the <<media-query>> it represents evaluates to true,
	and false otherwise.

	<div class='example'>
		For example, if a responsive site uses a particular breakpoint in several places,
		it can alias that with a reasonable name:

		<pre>
			@custom-media _narrow-window (max-width: 30em);

			@media (_narrow-window) {
				/* narrow window styles */
			}
			@media (_narrow-window) and (script) {
				/* special styles for when script is allowed */
			}
			/* etc */
		</pre>
	</div>
