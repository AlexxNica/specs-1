<h2 id='intro'>
Introduction</h2>

	[[CSS3-TRANSITIONS]] provide web authors with the ability to generate smooth transitioning effects
	when mutating the CSS of their web pages.
	However, the transitions that can be generated in this manner are limited in important ways,
	which make it difficult or impossible to use them in some cases.

	In particular,
	CSS Transitions only operate on <em>computed style</em> values,
	such as between ''100px'' and ''200px'';
	values that rely on layout,
	such as ''width: auto'',
	can't be used as the start or end of a transition.

	Furthermore, CSS Transitions only work over actual CSS property values,
	but some of aspects of an element one might wish to transition are derived from other properties
	rather than being directly specified.
	For example, the position and size of an element positioned with Grid Layout
	is derived from its <a>grid-placement properties</a>,
	rather than being directly specified.
	An author can transition the <a>grid-placement properties</a>,
	but that will merely cause the element to "skip" from cell to cell
	as its 'grid-row-start' and similar properties transition as integers;
	it won't have the desired effect of making the element smoothly move between its start and end position.
	Relatedly, there is no reasonable way to express a transition when an element enters or leaves the document.

	These shortcomings make [[CSS3-TRANSITIONS]] unsuitable for specifying transitions between laid out states of a web page.
	This specification provides a set of primitive JavaScript methods
	to enable transition-like graphical effects for complex layout changes.

<h3 id='examples'>
Motivating Examples</h3>

	Layout transition primitives can be used to programmatically control transitions between layout states.
	For example:

	<div class='example'>
		To transition element <code>myDiv</code> from an initial laid out position to a new position:

		<pre>
			myDiv.suspendPainting();
			CSS.elementSources.myDivSnapshot = myDiv.snapshot();
			var div = document.createElement('div');
			div.style.position = 'absolute';
			div.style.left = myDiv.offsetLeft + 'px';
			// ...
			div.style.backgroundImage = 'element(myDivSnapshot)';
			document.body.appendChild(div);
			// perform layout
			div.animate({left: myDiv.offsetLeft, ... }, 1).source.onEnd(function() {
				myDiv.resumePainting();
				div.remove();
			});
		</pre>
	</div>

	Layout transition primitives also allow element insertions and removals to be smoothed.
	For example:

	<div class='example'>
		In this example, afterDiv is the last div in a list.
		We wish to grow newDiv in-place before afterDiv,
		smoothly moving afterDiv down as we do so.

		<pre>
			container.suspendPainting();
			CSS.elementSources.afterDivSnapshot = afterDiv.snapshot();
			// .. create and insert snapshot element (see previous example)
			container.appendBefore(afterDiv, newDiv);
			var bounds = newDiv.recastElement();
			new ParGroup([
				bounds.animate([{height: 0}, {height: bounds.height}], 1),
				div.animate({top: afterDiv.top}, 1)
			]).source.onEnd(function() {
				myDiv.resumePainting();
				div.remove();
			});
		</pre>
	</div>

	When combined with [[CSS4-IMAGES]],
	layout transition primitves allow crossfade and transfade effects to be scripted.
	For example:

	<div class='example'>
		<pre>
			myDiv.suspendPainting();
			CSS.elementSources.before = myDiv.snapshot();
			// .. create and insert snapshot element (see previous example)
			// perform layout
			CSS.elementSources.after = myDiv.snapshot();
			div.style.transition = 'background-image 1s';
			div.style.backgroundImage = 'element(after)';
			setTimeout(function() {
				myDiv.resumePainting();
				div.remove();
			}, 1000);
		</pre>
	</div>

<h2 id='defs'>
Definitions</h2>

	For the purpose of this specification:

	<ul>
		<li>
			the <dfn interface>Promise</dfn> interface is defined in
			the <a href='https://github.com/domenic/promises-unwrapping'>Promises draft specification</a>.

		<li>
			the <dfn method for='Element'>getClientBoundingRect()</dfn> method is defined in
			the [[CSSOM-VIEW]] specification.
	</ul>

<h2 id='idl'>
IDL</h2>

	<pre class='idl'>
		partial interface Element {
			void suspendPainting();
			void resumePainting();
			OpaqueImageSnapshot snapshot();
			ElementBounds recastElement();
			void cancelRecast();
		};

		interface OpaqueImageSnapshot {
			Promise ready();
		};

		interface ElementBounds {
			attribute DOMString left;
			attribute DOMString top;
			attribute DOMString width;
			attribute DOMString height;
			attribute DOMString transform;
			attribute DOMString transformOrigin;
			attribute DOMString opacity;
			attribute DOMString overflow;
		};
	</pre>

	<p class='issue'>
		Ensure that ElementBounds implements Animatable,
		assuming that this idea makes it into the Web Animations specification.

<h2 id='suspending'>
Suspending Painting - the suspendPainting() and resumePainting() methods</h2>

	The <a method>suspendPainting()</a> and <a method>resumePainting()</a> methods on elements
	allow an author to control whether an element "paints",
	or is displayed on the screen.
	This is similar to using the 'visibility' property,
	but more explicit and slightly more powerful.
	Like 'visibility' and unlike other properties such as 'display',
	the element is still laid out and takes up space on the page as normal
	even if it's not being painted.

	Note: Suspending the painting of an element is commonly used with the other methods in this specification,
	to get the original element "out of the way" while script is simulating a transition of the element with snapshots and recastings.

	When <a method>suspendPainting()</a> is called on an element,
	the element's <dfn>painting suspended flag</dfn> must be set.
	When <a method>resumePainting()</a> is called on an element,
	the element's <a>painting suspended flag</a> must be unset.

	When an element's <a>painting suspended flag</a> is toggled from unset to set,
	its subtree must be repainted.
	<p class='issue'>This is actually trying to introduce the notion that suspendPainting is an entry in the style updates queue. How should this be worded?

	An element is <dfn>suspended</dfn> if its <a>painting suspended flag</a> is set,
	or if it has a parent element and that parent element is <a>suspended</a>.

	Whether the <a>painting suspended flag</a> is set or unset must not change if the element is added or removed from the document.

	When an element is <a>suspended</a>,
	its generated box is invisible
	(fully transparent, nothing is drawn),
	but still affects layout.
	<span class='note'>This is similar to the effects of ''visibility: hidden''</span>

	Note: Calling <a method>resumePainting()</a> on an element which is <a>suspended</a>
	due to an ancestor having its <a>painting suspended flag</a> set will do nothing;
	the element's <a>painting suspended flag</a> is already unset.

<h2 id='snapshotting'>
Snapshotting Elements - The snapshot() method</h2>

	The <a method>snapshot()</a> method takes a "snapshot" of an element,
	returning an image of the element at that time
	(even if the element is currently <a>suspended</a>)
	which is useful in implementing layout transitions,
	as described in the Examples section of this document.

	When <a method>snapshot()</a> is called on an element <var>el</var>,
	the user agent must perform the following steps:

	<ol>
		<li>
			Let <var>snapshot</var> be a newly-created <a interface>OpaqueImageSnapshot</a> object.
			Return <var>snapshot</var>,
			and complete the rest of these steps asynchronously.

		<li>
			Create a new <a>style-dependent action</a> <var>action</var>
			which, when executed,
			<a title="capture the current rendering">captures the current rendering</a> of <var>el</var>,
			associates the rendering with <var>snapshot</var>,
			and resolves <var>snapshot</var>'s ready promise with <code>undefined</code>.

		<li>
			Push <var>action</var> onto <var>el</var>'s <a>style updates queue</a>.
	</ol>

	When asked to <dfn>capture the current rendering</dfn> of an element <var>el</var>,
	the user agent must produce
	the image that would be represented by an ''element()'' function referencing <var>el</var> at that moment,
	with the image having the same width and height as <var>el</var> does at that moment.
	If <var>el</var> is currently <a>suspended</a>,
	for the purposes of generating this image it is treated as being not <a>suspended</a>.

	Note: Only the current element's <a>suspended</a> state is altered
	for the purposes of generating a snapshot image.
	If descendant elements are also marked as <a>suspended</a>,
	then those elements will remain transparent in the snapshot.

	Note: The image does not necessarily have to be a raster bitmap,
	as the actual image data is never directly exposed to the page.
	For example, some user agents use an intermediate vector-like representation of an element
	before the rasterization step;
	this alternative representation may be produced instead,
	so that the image can be rendered accurately at any target size
	without scaling artifacts.

	Note: Due to the way the <a>style updates queue</a> works,
	if an author generates a snapshot
	<em>before</em> creating a new element and assigning the snapshot as a background image,
	it's guaranteed that there will be no FOUC (flash of unstyled content).
	Any other order <em>might</em> generate a FOUC,
	depending on timing and user-agent-specific behavior.

	Note: Snapshots never "expire" or otherwise become unusable,
	even if the element they are snapshotting is removed or deleted.


<h3 id='snapshots'>
Snapshots: the <code>OpaqueImageSnapshot</code> object</h3>

	<a interface>OpaqueImageSnapshot</a> objects are returned by the <a method>snapshot()</a> method,
	and represent the rendering of an element at the time that <a method>snapshot()</a> is called.

	For security reasons,
	the image data represented by an <a interface>OpaqueImageSnapshot</a> object is not obtainable by any means;
	the image can only be displayed indirectly,
	by using the <a interface>OpaqueImageSnapshot</a> object
	in conjunction with CSS's ''element()'' function
	and the <a attribute>elementSources</a> map.

	An <a interface>OpaqueImageSnapshot</a> object might represent an image.
	If it does, it provides a <a>paint source</a>,
	with the width, height, and appearance of the image it represents.

	When the <a method>ready()</a> method of an <a interface>OpaqueImageSnapshot</a> <var>snapshot</var> is called,
	user agents must perform the following steps:

	<ol>
		<li>
			Let <var>ready promise</var> be a newly-created Promise.
			Return it,
			and perform the rest of these steps asynchronously.

		<li>
			When <var>snapshot</var> represents an image,
			resolve <var>promise</var> with <code>undefined</code>.
	</ol>

	<p class='issue'>
		Is there any way for a snapshot to fail?
		Deleting the element before it's rendered?

<h2 id='recasting'>
Recasting Painting - The recastElement() and cancelRecast() methods</h2>

	While <a href="#snapshotting">snapshotting</a> elements into static images
	is appropriate for many layout transitions,
	sometimes it is necessary to continuously lay out the element and its contents
	as it changes size and shape.
	However, the actual element can't be used for this purpose,
	as it's busy occupying space in the layout.
	Instead, a <a>suspended</a> element can have its painting <strong>recasted</strong>,
	rendering it at an explicitly-set size and position
	without moving it in the layout as far as the outer page is concerned.

	When the <a method>recastElement()</a> method is called on an element <var>el</var>,
	the user agent must perform the following steps:

	<ol>
		<li>
			If the element is not currently <a>suspended</a>,
			throw a ??? error
			and exit this algorithm.

		<li>
			If the element already has an associated <a interface>ElementBounds</a> object,
			return that object
			and exit this algorithm.

		<li>
			Create a new <a interface>ElementBounds</a> object <var>bounds</var>
			associated with <var>el</var>.
			<a>Initialize the element bounds</a>.
			Return <var>bounds</var>.
	</ol>

	While an element has an associated <a interface>ElementBounds</a> object,
	it is <dfn>recast</dfn>.

	If an element is <a>recast</a>,
	and stops being <a>suspended</a> for any reason,
	it must <dfn>cancel recast</dfn>,
	which causes its associated <a interface>ElementBounds</a> object to no longer be associated with it.

	While an element is <a>recast</a>,
	it must be laid out twice.
	The first is as normal for a <a>suspended</a> element,
	to establish the space that the element takes up in the page.

	The second treats the element as <a>absolutely positioned</a>
	with the <a>initial containing block</a> as its containing block,
	and the element's 'width', 'height', 'left', 'top', 'opacity', and 'transform' properties
	set to the corresponding values from the element's associated <a interface>ElementBounds</a> object
	rather than the values obtained from the cascade.
	Additionally, the element's 'right' and 'bottom' properties must be treated as ''right/auto'' for this layout.
	The element must then render as normal based on the results of this layout.

	Modifying the element's associated <a interface>ElementBounds</a> object
	must cause the element to perform its second layout with the new values,
	as if this were an ordinary style change.

	Querying the style of any properties on the element
	must return the results of the first layout,
	not the second.

	Note: Note that while an element is <a>recast</a>,
	any additional calls to <a method>recastElement()</a> will return the same <a interface>ElementBounds</a> object.

	When the <a method>cancelRecast()</a> method is called on an element,
	the user agent must <a>cancel recast</a> on it.

	Removing a <a>recast</a> element from the document
	causes that element to <a>cancel recast</a>.
	However, atomic moves within the same document do not <a>cancel recast</a>.

	Note: recasting an element does not alter the suspended state of
	descendents of that element.

<h3 id='element-bounds'>
The <code>ElementBounds</code> Object</h3>

	The <a interface>ElementBounds</a> object controls the position and size of a <a>recast</a> element's rendering.
	It is returned by calling <a method>recastElement()</a> on an element.

	When asked to <dfn>initialize the element bounds</dfn> for an element <var>el</var>
	and an <a interface>ElementBounds</a> object <var>eb</var>,
	user agents must perform the following steps:

	<ol>
		<li>
			Lay out the element as normal.

		<li>
			Set the <a attribute>width</a>,
			<a attribute>height</a>,
			<a attribute>opacity</a>,
			and <a attribute>transform</a> attributes of <var>eb</var>
			to the used values of the corresponding properties from <var>el</var>.

		<li>
			Set the <a attribute>left</a> and <a attribute>top</a> attributes of <var>eb</var>
			to the offsets of <var>el</var>'s left and top edges, respectively,
			relative to the top left corner of the initial containing block.
	</ol>

<h2 id='style-updates'>
Appendix A: The Style Updates Queue</h2>

	Note: This section probably isn't best placed here,
	but I need some terms defined that aren't currently defined.

	Each element in a document is associated with a <dfn export>style updates queue</dfn>,
	containing <a>style updates</a> and <a>style-dependent actions</a>.
	A <dfn>style update</dfn> is a pending currently-unapplied change made to the style of an element on the page
	which might have an effect on the style, layout, or rendering of the element.
	A <dfn>style-dependent action</dfn> is an operation which relies on the element's style, layout, and/or rendering
	being fully up-to-date.

	Whenever a change is made to the page's style that may affect an element,
	a <a>style update</a> must be pushed onto the element's <a>style updates queue</a>.
	The element's style, layout, and/or rendering must not be updated
	unless a corresponding <a>style update</a> is at the front of the <a>style updates queue</a>.
	When a <a>style update</a> is applied,
	it must be popped from the queue.

	Similarly, <a>style-dependent actions</a> must not be executed
	unless they are at the front of the <a>style updates queue</a>.
	When they are executed,
	they must be popped from the queue.

	User agents may delay applying <a>style updates</a> as long as they consider reasonable
	so as to batch any work caused by updating styles, layout, and rendering.
	User agents should prioritize applying <a>style updates</a>
	that precede a <a>style-dependent action</a>
	when a <a>style-dependent action</a> is in the queue.
